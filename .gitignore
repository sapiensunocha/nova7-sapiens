# Other JSON files (be cautious if you have JSON files you DO want to commit)
# If you have other JSON files you need, you'll need to explicitly re-include them.
# Example: !public/data.json
# For maximum safety, it's better to explicitly ignore known sensitive JSONs
# rather than blanket ignoring all JSONs if you need some.
# If ALL JSONs in your project are sensitive (like config with secrets), then keep *.json
# Otherwise, be very specific.
